ğŸ“˜ Data Structures in C â€“ My Learning Journey This repo is a collection of data structures I've learned and implemented in C as a part of my CSE studies. It includes arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and more. Each program is written from scratch with comments to help me (and maybe others) understand the logic better.
