# 🔍 Searching Algorithms in C

This folder contains C programs that implement two of the most commonly used searching algorithms:

- **Linear Search**
- **Binary Search**

These programs are written in a simple and easy-to-understand way — perfect for beginners who are learning Data Structures in C.

## 📂 Files Included

- `linear_search.c` – Performs linear search on an array.
- `binary_search.c` – Performs binary search on a sorted array.

## 💡 Algorithm Overview

### 1. Linear Search
- Goes through each element one by one.
- Works on **unsorted** arrays.
- Simple but not very efficient for large data sets.

### 2. Binary Search
- Works only on **sorted** arrays.
- Divides the search space in half each time.
- Much faster than linear search for large arrays.
